Founded in 1855. Berea College is distinctive among post-secondary institutions for providing free education to students and for having been the first [[college]] in the [[Southern United States]] to be [[coeducation]]al and [[racial integration|racially integrated]].<ref name=QuickFacts/> Berea College charges no [[tuition]]; every admitted student is provided the equivalent of a four-year, full-tuition scholarship (currently worth $83,600; $20,900 per year).<ref name=QuickFacts>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/prospectivestudents/tuitioncosts/default.asp| title=About Berea College - Quick Facts |publisher=Berea College}}</ref>\n\nBerea offers [[Bachelor's degree]]s in 32 majors.<ref name=QuickFacts/> It has a full-participation work-study program where students are required to work at least 10 hours per week in campus and service jobs in over 130 departments. Berea's primary service region is Southern [[Appalachia]], but students come from 46 states in the [[United States]] and 58 other countries, with approximately one in three students an ethnic minority or international.<ref name=QuickFacts/>\n\n==History==\n\nFounded in 1855 by the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Gregg Fee]] (1816–1901), Berea College admitted both black and white students in a fully integrated [[curriculum]], making it the first non-segregated, [[coeducational]] [[college]] in [[Southern United States|the South]] and one of a handful of institutions of higher learning to admit both male and female students in the mid-19th century. The [[college]] began as a one-room schoolhouse that also served as a church on Sundays on land that was granted to Fee by politician and [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]]. Fee named the new community after the biblical [[Berea (Bible)|Berea]]. Although the school's first articles of incorporation were adopted in 1859, founder John Gregg Fee and the teachers were forced out of the area by pro-[[slavery]] supporters in that same year.\n\nFee spent the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years raising funds for the school, trying to provide for his family in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], and working at [[Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park|Camp Nelson]]. He returned afterward to continue his work at Berea. He spent nearly 18 months working mostly at Camp Nelson, where he helped provide facilities for the freedmen and their families, as well as teaching and preaching. He helped get funds for barracks, a hospital, school and church.\n\n[[File:BereaCollegeAd1900.png|thumb|right|An ad for Berea College from 1900, placed in a [[African American newspapers|black newspaper]] in [[Minnesota]].]]\nIn 1866, Berea's first full year after the war, it had 187 students, of whom 96 were black and 91 white. It began with preparatory classes to ready students for advanced study at the college level. In 1869, the first college students were admitted, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were awarded in 1873.\n\nIn 1904, the [[Kentucky]] state legislature's passage of the \"[[Day Law]]\" disrupted Berea's interracial education by prohibiting education of black and white students together. The college challenged the law in state court and further appealed to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]''. When the challenge failed, the college had to become a [[Racial segregation|segregated school]], but it set aside funds to help establish the [[Lincoln Institute (Kentucky)|Lincoln Institute]] near [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] to educate black students.<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.berea.edu/about/history/ |title=About Berea College - History |publisher=Berea College}}</ref>  In 1925 famed advertiser [[Bruce Barton]], a future congressman, sent a letter to 24 wealthy men in America to raise funds for the college. Every single letter was returned with a minimum of $1,000 in donation. In 1950, when the law was amended to allow integration of schools at the college level, Berea promptly resumed its integrated policies.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Berea was one of 131 colleges nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a navy commission.<ref name=\"berea\">{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/alumni/navyv12/deceased.asp |title=Navy V-12 List of Deceased |publisher=[[Berea, Kentucky]]: Berea College |last= |first= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |year=2011}}</ref>\n\nUp until the 1960s, Berea provided pre-college education in addition to college level curriculum. In 1968, the elementary and secondary schools (Foundation School) were discontinued in favor of focusing on undergraduate college education.<ref name=History/>\n\n==Rankings==\nThe 2014 annual ranking of ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' categorizes Berea as 'more selective' and rates it the 76th best liberal arts college in the nation and 11th for \"Best Undergraduate Teaching.\"<ref name=\"U.S. News & World Report\">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/berea-college-156295/overall-rankings |title=Best Colleges – National Liberal Arts Colleges Rankings |year=2014 |publisher=''U.S. News & World Report''}}</ref> ''[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]]'' places Berea 63rd in its 2014 ranking of best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kiplinger.com/tool/college/T014-S001-kiplinger-s-best-values-in-private-colleges/index.php?table=lib_arts&state_code%5B%5D=ALL&id%5B%5D=none |publisher=''Kiplinger's Personal Finance'' | title=Best Values in Private Colleges}}</ref> ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', which rates schools based on their contribution to the public good in terms of Social Mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), Research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and Service (encouraging students to give something back to their country), rated Berea 3rd among liberal arts colleges in the United States in 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2013/liberal_arts_rank.php |publisher=''Washington Monthly'' | title=2013 Liberal Arts College Rankings}}</ref>\nDespite the overall drop in application and percentage yield across the nation, some schools including Berea continue to see an increase in the percentage of accepted students that choose to enroll, in both the National universities and Top Liberal Arts ranking, Berea outranked all top schools except [[Harvard]] and [[Stanford]].<ref name=\"U.S. News & World Report\"/>\nBerea College is among the few colleges and universities in the world committed to making education affordable to each admitted student regardless of their financial circumstances. A college or university that promises to make sure every penny of an accepted student's demonstrated financial need is covered through grants, work-study, scholarships, and in some cases, federal student loans, Berea is considered a 100% meet-need school.<ref name=\"U.S. News & World Report\"/> In 2014 Berea College students received more [[Benjamin A. Gilman|Gilman]] [[Scholarships]] (Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program) than those of any other private school in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Admissions profile==\n\nFor the Class of 2017 (enrolled Fall 2013), Berea received 1,620 applications and accepted 551 (34.0%).<ref name=CommonDataSet>{{cite web |url=http://www.berea.edu/ira/wp-content/blogs.dir/85/files/2012/06/CDS2013.pdf |title=Berea College Common Data Set 2013-2014, Part C |publisher=Berea College}}</ref>  The number enrolling was 397; the yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) was 72.1%.<ref name=CommonDataSet/> - ranking only behind [[Harvard]] and [[Stanford]] in the 2014 CommonDataSet.

The college provides significant funding to assist students in studying abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/cie| title=Center for International Education: Berea College}}</ref> Berea students are also eligible to win the [[Thomas J. Watson Fellowship]], which provides funding for a year of study abroad following graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.berea.edu/cie/abroad/scholarships/watson.php| title=Thomas J. Watson Fellowship: CIE-Berea College}}</ref> Like many private colleges, Berea does not enroll students based upon semester hours. Berea College uses a course credit system, which has the following equivalencies:\n\n*A .25 credit course is the equivalent of 1 semester hour.\n*A .50 credit course is the equivalent of 2 semester hours.\n*A .75 credit course is equivalent to 3 semester hours.\n*A 1.00 credit course is the equivalent to 4 semester hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/academicservices/adviserguide/transferadvising/tcwcpe.asp| title=Academic Services Advisor Guide: Berea College}}</ref>\n\nAll students are required to attend the college on a full-time basis, which is 3.00 course credits of enrollment, or 12 semester hours. Students must be enrolled in at least 4.00 course credits to be considered for the Dean's list. Enrollment in 4.75 or more course credits requires the approval of the Academic Adviser, and a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.30.There are also \noptional Summer opportunities to engage in study. Students may take between 1 and 2.25 credits during Summer. One Berea course credit is equivalent to four semester hours (6 quarter hours). Part-time enrollment is not permitted except during Summer term. A cumulative [[GPA]] of 2.0 is required in all majors in order to graduate with a bachelor's degree.\n\n===Scholarships and work program===\nBerea College provides all students with full-tuition scholarships and many receive support for room and board as well. Berea College charges no tuition; every admitted student is provided the equivalent of a four-year, full-tuition scholarship (currently worth $100,000; $25,000 per year). Admission to the College is granted only to students who need financial assistance (as determined by the [[FAFSA]]); in general, applications are accepted only from those whose family income falls within the bottom 40% of U.S. households. About 75% of the college's incoming class is drawn from the Appalachian region of the South and some adjoining areas, and about 8% are international students. Generally, no more than one student is admitted from a given country in a single year (with the exception of countries in distress such as [[Liberia]]). This policy ensures that 70 or more nationalities are usually represented in the student body of Berea College. All international students are admitted on full scholarships with the same regard for financial need as U.S. students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/prospectivestudents/admissioninfo/requirements.asp| title=Admission Requirements: Prospective Students}}</ref>\n\nIn order to support its extensive scholarship program, Berea College has one of the largest financial reserves of any American college when measured on a per-student basis. The endowment was $1.012 billion as of June 30, 2013.<ref name=Endowment/> The base of Berea College's finances is dependent on substantial contributions from individuals, foundations, corporations that support the mission of the college and donations from alumni. A solid investment strategy increased the endowment from $150 million in 1985 to its current amount.<ref>Brull, Steven. (September 2005). \"Appalachian spring\". ''Institutional Investor'', p. 35.</ref>\n\nAs a [[work college]], Berea has a student work program in which all students work 10 or more hours per week on campus. Berea is one of only eight colleges in the [[United States]] and one of two in [[Kentucky]] ([[Alice Lloyd College]] being the other) to have mandatory work study programs. Employment opportunities range from bussing tables at the [[Boone Tavern|Boone Tavern Hotel]], a historic business owned by the college, to writing and publishing the students' newspaper ''[http://pub.berea.edu/pinnacle//The Pinnacle]'', or managing the hanging and focusing of lights for the productions at the Theatre Lab. Other job duties include janitorial labor, building management, resident assistance, teaching assistance, food service, gardening and groundskeeping, [[information technology]], [[woodworking]], [[weaving]], and secretarial work. Some of the work-study has helped to extend and support practice of traditional crafts from the Appalachian region, such as [[weaving]]. Berea College has helped make the town a center for quality arts and crafts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/laborprogram/about.asp| title=About Our Labor Program- Berea College}}</ref>\n\nStudents are currently paid an hourly wage from $4.10 to $6.55 by the college, based on the WLS (\"Work, Learning, and Service\") level attached to individual labor positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/labor-program-office/pay-schedule-scale/| title=Pay Schedule & Scale}}</ref> The college regularly increases student pay on a yearly basis, but it has never been equivalent to the federal minimum wage in the school's history. Because of the scheduling demands of both an academic requirement and a labor requirement, students are not allowed to work at off-campus jobs.\n\n===Campus life===\n[[Technology]] is an important part of life at Berea College. Since 2002, all students at Berea receive laptops that they take with them when they graduate. Students are not required to pay for the computers, though they do provide a small fee to support the technological infrastructure.\n\nStudents are also not allowed to have cars on campus without a special permit, and student permits for cars are rarely granted to first- or second-year students. The college provides students with supplemental transport through a shuttle bus system.\n\n===Athletics===\nBerea College teams are nicknamed as the Mountaineers. The college is currently a transitioning member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), competing as a [[NCAA Division III independent schools|Division III Independent]] school. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball.\n\nOn February 20, 2012, the NCAA announced it had granted Berea permission to begin a one-year period exploring membership in its [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]], non-scholarship athletic program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest+news/2012/february/diii+panel+suggests+consequences+for+not+meeting+conference+requirements |title=DIII panel suggests consequences for not meeting conference requirements |publisher=NCAA.org |date= |accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Christian identity===\n\nBerea was founded by Protestant [[Christian]]s. It maintains a Christian identity separate from any particular [[Christian denomination|denomination]]. The college's motto, \"[[God]] has made of one blood all peoples of the earth\", is taken from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 17|17:26]]. One General Studies course is focused on Christian faith, as every student is required to take an Understandings of Christianity course. In an effort to be sensitive to the diverse preferences and experiences of students and faculty, these courses are designed to be taught with respect for the unique spiritual journey of each individual, regardless of religious identification.\n\n==Library collections==\n\nThe Hutchins Library maintains an extensive collection of books, archives, and music pertaining to the history and culture of the Southern Appalachian region. The Southern Appalachian Archives contain organizational records, personal papers, oral histories, and photographs. Included are the papers of the [[Council of the Southern Mountains]] (1912–1989) and the [[Appalachian Volunteers]] (1963–1970).\n\n==Sustainability==\n\nBerea's Campus Environmental Policy Committee (CEPC) is developing a set of indicators by which to measure the progress of the college toward ecological sustainability, creates bi-annual reports on that progress, and links the school's efforts to green campus operations with its mission to raise consciousness of environmental issues among faculty, students, and staff.<ref name=\"Campus Environmental Policy Committee\">{{cite web\n| title =Sustainability Initiatives: -SENS, Berea College\n| publisher =Berea College\n| url =http://www.berea.edu/SENS/sustainabilityinitiatives/cepc.asp\n| accessdate = 2009-07-09 }}</ref>\n\nBerea addresses environmental sustainability from both an operational and an intellectual perspective; the school emphasizes an experiential education for its students, combining hands-on work with academic exploration.<ref name=\"Ecological Design\">{{cite web\n| title =Ecological Design\n| publisher =Berea College\n| url =http://www.berea.edu/SENS/sustainabilityinitiatives/ecologicaldesign.asp\n| accessdate = 2009-07-09 }}</ref> Berea's Ecovillage is a living/learning community comprising 50 apartments.

The Fair Trade University status is awarded to schools that meet five criteria: building a Fair Trade Advisory Council, including Fair Trade in applicable curriculum, offering Fair Trade products at campus outlets, using Fair Trade products on campus, and passing a university-wide resolution to support a commitment to Fair Trade.\n\n==Presidents of Berea College==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!
